ShortDescription: Audio loudness analyzer and gain adjustment tool for mastering and DJ workflows
Description: |-
  headroom simulates the behavior of Rekordbox's Auto Gain feature, but with a key difference:
  it identifies files with available headroom (True Peak below the target ceiling) and applies
  gain adjustment without using a limiter.

  This tool is designed for DJs and producers who want to maximize loudness while preserving
  dynamics, ensuring tracks hit the optimal True Peak ceiling without clipping.

  Key Features:
  - Uses mp3rgain CLI for lossless MP3 gain, ffmpeg for analysis & lossless formats
  - Smart True Peak ceiling based on AES TD1008 recommendations
  - Multiple processing methods: ffmpeg for lossless formats, mp3rgain for lossless MP3
  - Non-destructive workflow with automatic backups
  - Metadata preservation: Rekordbox tags, cue points remain intact
  - No limiter: Pure gain adjustment only - dynamics are preserved
  - Interactive CLI with two-stage confirmation
